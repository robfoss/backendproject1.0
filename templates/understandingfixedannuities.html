                                <h3>What Is a Fixed Annuity?</h3>
								<p>
                                    A fixed <a href="/category/annuity">annuity</a> is a type of insurance contract that promises to pay the buyer a specific, guaranteed interest rate on their 
                                    contributions to the account. By contrast, a <a href="/category/understandingvariableannuities">variable annuity</a> pays interest that can fluctuate based on the performance of an investment 
                                    portfolio chosen by the account's owner. Fixed annuities are often used in retirement planning.
                                </p>

                                <h2>How a Fixed Annuity Works</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Investors can buy a fixed annuity with either a lump sum of money or a series of payments over time. The insurance company, 
                                    in turn, guarantees that the account will earn a certain rate of interest. This period is known as the accumulation phase.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Rolling Over Funds With Variable Annuities</h2>
                               
                                <p>
                                    When the annuity owner, or annuitant, elects to begin receiving regular income from the annuity, the insurance company calculates 
                                    those payments based on the amount of money in the account, the owner's age, how long the payments are to continue, and other factors. 
                                    This begins the payout phase. The payout phase may continue for a specified number of years or for the rest of the owner's life.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    During the accumulation phase, the account grows tax-deferred. hen the account holder annuitizes the contract, distributions 
                                    are taxed based on an exclusion ratio. This is the ratio of the account holder's premium payments to the to the amount accumulated 
                                    in the account that is based on gains from the interest earned during the accumulation phase. The premiums paid are excluded, the portion 
                                    attributable to gains is taxed. This is often expressed as a percentage.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h2>Benefits of a Fixed Annuity</h2>
								<p>
                                    Owners of fixed annuities can benefit from these contracts in a variety of ways.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Predictable investment returns</h3>

                                <p>
                                    The rates on fixed annuities are derived from the yield that the life insurance company generates from its investment 
                                    portfolio, which is invested primarily in high-quality corporate and government bonds. The insurance company is then 
                                    responsible for paying whatever rate it has promised in the annuity contract. This contrasts with variable annuities, where the 
                                    annuity owner chooses the underlying investments and therefore assumes much of the investment risk.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Guaranteed minimum rates</h3>

								<p>
                                    Once the initial guarantee period in the contract expires, the insurer can adjust the rate based on a stated formula or on the 
                                    yield it is earning on its investment portfolio. As a measure of protection against declining interest rates, fixed annuity 
                                    contracts typically include a minimum rate guarantee.
                                </p>

								<h3>Tax-deferred growth</h3>
								<p>
                                    Because a fixed annuity is a tax-qualified vehicle, its earnings grow and compound tax deferred; annuity owners are taxed only when 
                                    they take money from the account, either through occasional withdrawals or as regular income. This tax deferral can make a significant 
                                    difference in how the account builds up over time, particularly for people in higher tax brackets. The same is true of qualified retirement 
                                    accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, which also grow tax deferred.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Guaranteed income payments</h3>
								<p>
                                    Fixed annuities may be converted into an immediate annuity at any time the owner selects. The annuity will then 
                                    generate a guaranteed income payout for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Relative safety of principal</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The life insurance company is responsible for the security of the money invested in the annuity and for fulfilling 
                                    any promises made in the contract. Unlike most bank accounts, annuities are not federally insured. For that reason, 
                                    buyers should only consider doing business with life insurance companies that earn high grades for financial strength 
                                    from the major independent ratings agencies.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Before You Invest</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Finally, annuities often carry fees, compared with other types of investments. Anyone interested in an annuity should make sure they 
                                    understand all the fees involved before they commit. It also pays to shop around because fees and other terms can 
                                    vary widely from one insurer to the next.
                                </p>
