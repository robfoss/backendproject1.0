                                <h3>Funding an Annuity</h3>
								<p>
                                    As you come increasingly closer to retirement age you need to seriously consider the potential benefits of 
                                    lasting income that can keep up with the rising costs of retirement and healthcare. As individuals are living 
                                    longer there has never been a better time than now to consider having a diversified retirement portfolio that 
                                    carefully encapsulates all of your various needs.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    You may want to consider the potential benefits of investing a part of your portfolio and doing this may increase the probability 
                                    that your money won’t run out as you age. Thankfully, there are plenty of great resources available online (including some guidance from the IRS) 
                                    if you want to learn more about rolling over funds. Read on to learn more about some of the things you need to consider when you’re 
                                    contemplating a rollover of funds into an annuity product.

                                <h3>Rolling Over Funds With Variable Annuities</h3>
                               
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image left">
                                        <img src="/images/sea.svg">

                                    One of the common tools that individuals will use in this situation is what’s known as a variable annuity. 
                                    The money that you put into a variable annuity is invested in bond and stock funds and these build until you begin 
                                    collecting checks. After the time period in which you begin collecting checks, your withdrawals are guaranteed not to fall below a base level.

                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Right now those base levels for a 65-year-old individual are usually between 4.5 percent to 5 percent of the balance in the account 
                                    when you begin to take money out. This is one of the reasons that these annuities have become so popular with individuals looking for 
                                    rollover opportunities in recent years. Given the fact that a guaranteed investment return is a common feature in these types of annuities, 
                                    your balance could actually be higher for calculating withdrawals, but you might also want to factor in paying percentages each year based 
                                    on investment and other fees linked to these kinds of annuities.
                                </p>
                                
                                
								<p>
                                    In recent years, investors have poured as much as $141 billion into variable annuities with more than 3/4 of that number going 
                                    into products that have these kinds of guarantees. If you are concerned about funding your retirement and doing so safely, you may 
                                    be contemplating the potential here as well.

                                <h3>Tips for Using Variable Annuities</h3>

								<p>
                                    If this is your first foray into <a href="/category/variableAnnuity">variable annuities</a>, one key tip is to keep it simple. You want to be focused on helping your 
                                    money last and the best way to do this is to use a low cost immediate annuity that alongside any pensions retirement plans 
                                    and social security will help to supplement your fixed retirement costs. You can price immediate annuities relatively easily 
                                    and determine what your monthly income would be. Additionally, make sure to shop around in terms of fees and costs. If you focus 
                                    solely on guaranteed income with an opportunity for growth, make sure you look at the prices and fees you will pay for having an annuity like this.
                                </p>

								<p>
                                    There are multiple factors to consider, including the rates, the costs, and other issues like customer service. Working with 
                                    a company with a solid financial background can make a big difference in your own confidence level when you are rolling over o
                                    ther funds into annuities.
