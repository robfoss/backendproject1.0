                            <p>
                                An individual retirement account (IRA), as the name implies, is a place to store those golden nest eggs 
                                for the golden years. But here's an interesting fact: Many senior workers and new retirees are still building 
                                their IRAs. More than half of the IRAs owned by those near or in retirement (60 or older) saw balance increases 
                                over a three-year period, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Even among IRAs owned by retirees (ages 71 to 74) who are just starting to take required minimum distributions 
                                (RMDs), nearly half of the accounts had increasing balances during this period.
                            </p>
                          
							<p>
                                All of which raises an interesting question: How does a traditional IRA work after retirement? What 
                                happens when it’s time to tap into those tax-deferred IRA earnings?

                            <p>
                                    Technically, the owner of an IRA can withdraw money (taking distributions, in Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-speak) 
                                    from an IRA at any time. If it happens before age 59½, though, the account owner will probably incur a 10% early-withdrawal 
                                    penalty in addition to income taxes. The taxes and penalty amount also depend on the tax-deductibility of 
                                    the contributions (determined by whether the account owner also has an employer-sponsored retirement plan).
                            </p>

                                    The IRS will waive this penalty when distributions are used for specific purposes, such as unreimbursed 
                                    medical expenses, health insurance, qualified higher education expenses, or to purchase a first home. An 
                                    account owner can also take a penalty-free loan from the IRA if they replace the money within 60 days

                                "A little-known strategy to access IRA funds without penalty before age 59½ is the 'reverse rollover,'" says James B. Twining, 
                                founder of Financial Plan Inc. in Bellingham, Wash. "This technique will work for those who are age 55 or older and have a 401(k) 
                                that accepts rollovers and allows for early retirement withdrawals at age 55. With this technique, IRA funds are first rolled into the 401(k), 
                                then the 401(k) funds are withdrawn without penalty."

                            <p>
                                At age 59½, an account owner can start taking distributions from the IRA penalty-free—though, of course, they're still subject 
                                to income taxes. IRA owners are not required to start taking distributions at 59½ or even once they retire. Owners can defer 
                                distributions for more than a decade after turning 60.

                                Just because RMDs have to be taken doesn't mean they have to be spent. There are several strategies to employ with the funds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, purchasing an annuity can turn assets into a stream of income payments for life. (There are some limitations on 
                                the types of annuities to fund with RMDs, so check with a tax pro.) Distributions can also be reinvested in municipal bonds,
                                 stocks, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another alternative: depositing your RMDs into a Roth IRA. You'll still have to pay income taxes on them, but the funds will 
                                be allowed to grow tax-free thereafter, and you are not obligated to take them out at any time or in any amount. The assets 
                                can be left in place, and bequeathed to survivors. If you do withdraw them, they won't be taxable, provided you hold the 
                                Roth account for five years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, you can convert the entire traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA. This is an especially good strategy if your 
                                tax bracket in retirement is actually going to be higher than it was in your working days. However, bear in mind you will 
                                owe income taxes on the entire account in the year you convert: In other words, you'll likely incur a hefty tax bill in 
                                the short run. 
                            </p>

                                Traditional IRAs have many complicated distribution and tax rules to keep in mind. It can be tricky to determine when and 
                                how much to withdraw and how to reinvest the distributions if they aren't spent otherwise. Start planning well before the 
                                milestone age of 72 to avoid having to make sudden moves with an IRA, and to determine how to best allocate these funds for 
                                maximum income and minimum taxes.
